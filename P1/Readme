## Compiling and Using

Just use javac TrafficAnimation.java to compile the program using the terminal. Then use java TrafficAnimation to run the program. You can also press the run button to compile and execute the program in eclipse.

## Discussion

It was a pretty difficult project. I used raw numbers while giving the attributes of the oval, lines and such and it was a really terrible idea because everything would disperse when the screen size was changed. So, I learnt to set the attribute in terms of height and width so that the objects are in relative position to the height and width of the screen.
