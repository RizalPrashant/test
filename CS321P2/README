OVERVIEW:

 This program implements a MaxHeap ADT using an array which is then used to
 implement Priority Queue ADT. Also, there are other classes present to
 create a CPU scheduling simulation.
INCLUDED FILES:

* MaxHeap.java == Maxheap Class
* PQueue.java  == PQueue Class
* Process.java  == Process Class
* ProcessGenerator.java == ProcessGenerator Class
* README == Readme File

COMPILING AND RUNNING:
Just right click on the project and go to run as===> then run it as a TestNG suite. or in terminal. compile javac CPUScheduler.java and the run it using the command java CPUSCheduler [arg1] [arg2] [arg3] [arg4][arg5]
 
PROGRAM DESIGN AND IMPORTANT CONCEPTS:

 For this program, a lot of heapNode object is used to make a MaxHeap using
 MaxHeap Class. Then the Priority Queue class implements the Maxheap class.
 Then, there is a Process class which builds processes and the Process is
 instantiated in the ProcessGenerator class. Then, the class with main method
 is CPUScheduler which runs the program.


TESTING:

To test the classes on eclipse, right click the project and run as a testNG
suite. You can see the test results in the console.
To see the result on terminal, go to your location of the project 
and there, use java CPUScheduler maxProcessTime maxPriorityLevel 
timeToIncrementPriority simulationTime processArrivalRate



DISCUSSION:
One of the problem I encountered was getting off by 1 error while 
randomly generating priority level and finishing time in the
getNewProcess of ProcessGenerator. I failed to increment some
while loops properly which is my my program used to get stuck
in endless loop sometimes. One important thing I learnt from
this project was reading UML Diagram. I think this diagram is
important since it helps so much to see the objects and classes
in your code interacting with each other as well as the methods
inside them and the return types of the methods.
It was pretty challenging to debug the MaxHeap class but with 
good use of testNG, debugger and simply testing by inserting print 
statements in between codes, I managed to fix those errors.
