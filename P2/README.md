# Project 2: Find Parking

## Overview

First the program asks for a number to be input as a seed and allocates the car's x and y position. It then asks to input the time needed to park the car. Then 4 random parking spaces are generated and the cost and distance taken to each parking space is also printed. Also, the closest parking lot is shown by the program.

## Compiling and Using

In the Command line, type in javac FindParking.java
Then type in javac ParkingSpot.java to compile.
Then to run, type java FindParking.java


## Discussion

The math.ceil function was a bit tricky especially because I took a while to figure out to type cast the time/10 to double. I understood how another class can be instantiated as an object in a class and its method called. For example, in this project, under the main class, I had to instantiate the FindParking.java so that I could use its methods like getCharge(), getLocationX() and such.
