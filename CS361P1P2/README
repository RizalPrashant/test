# Project 1 Part 2: Nondeterministic Finite Automata

* Author: Prashant Rizal

* Class: CS361 Section 2

* Semester: Spring 2018



## Overview



This program models a non-deterministic finite automation. The project helps

strengthen the concepts of packages in java and implementing interfaces and 

implementing graph search algorithms.



## Compiling and Using



To compile, from the terminal:

javac fa/nfa/NFADriver.java


Then, to run the program:

java fa.nfa.NFADriver ./tests/"name of your file here"
 

 Alternatively, from eclipse, you can run configurations then as an argument give the

 location of your text file then press run.

 

## Discussion

 One good thing to learn for this project was the implementation of graph search 
 
 algorithm which used queue and stack concepts.


## Testing


I compared the toString of my data with the expected results shown in the project

specifications.



## Extra Credit
